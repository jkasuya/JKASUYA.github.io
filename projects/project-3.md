summary: A calculator that takes in postfix expressions and solves them
---
The Postfix Calculator was a program I created in ICS 211, in the Spring 2017 semester. The project involved implementing a stack, which helped me to learn how stacks can be applied to real life scenarios. This project also helped me apply what I had previously learned in previous classes about postfix notation. 

One interesting element of this project was that I had to create an Exception class to handle various errors (exceptions) that could've potentially occured in this project. As there are many types of errors that could potentially occur in this project, finding each exception was the hardest part of this project.
