summary: A web app to help the students of the UH Manoa dorms know when a washer in their dorm is available.
---

Washer Watcher was an app that I created with a team for my ICS 314 Software Engineering 1 Class. This app was based on a very tough issue for students living in the UH Manoa dorms. As there are only around 3-4 washers per dorm, there are many moments when a student would attempt to do their laundry, only to find that all of the washers were taken. Washer Watcher attempts to alleviate this problem for students, providing them a user-friendly app to view the availability of washers in their dorm, as well as any notes or problems that other users have faced. Any notes or updates would be timestamped so users would know the reliability of the information provided. For example, here is the UI for one of the dorms.

This was the first project that I worked on that was "real-world leveled" and focused heavily on the principles of software engineering. We used issue-based project management on GitHub to keep track of the progress, we deployed the project after major updates occured, and we got users of the UH Manoa community to test out our app. Through this project I learned good communication skills with team members, how to use Meteor and Galaxy to develop and deploy an app respectively, and how to keep track and work on a project of somewhat larger size. 

My individual role on this project was mainly to get the homepage made and get the styling to be just right so that users would be greeted with a pretty, yet informative page. While I didn't specifically work on any of the back-end programming aspects of this application, I did fix some bugs/typos here and there. I was also responsible for getting people to test out the app and compiling their feedback to help us improve the app. Finally, I deployed the final version of the app here. This link was created specifically for the ICS 314 Spring 2018 semester, so it may or may not work currently.
