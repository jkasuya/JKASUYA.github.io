summary: A resursive sudoku solver that will take minutes to solve even the hardest possible sudoku problem.

The Recursive Sudoku Solver was a program I created in ICS 211, in the Spring 2017 semester. The project helped me to learn how recursion can be used as a trial and error to create solutions for certain problems. 

This project was very frustrating as it took a lot of understanding of recursive algorithms

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
