Learning a new language is always a struggle. For example, as a native English speaker, it is very hard learning Japanese. Learning a coding language applies the same way. The first time I learned Java in ICS 111 it almost seemed foreign. Learning all the quirks about programming and learning all the syntax made it very hard. Learning Javascript now however, was surprisingly very easy. 

Javascript is almost exactly like Java, so learning it was very simple. One of the biggest differences is that variables don't need a type (like int or String), which is actually very convienient. There are some other differences from Java (mostly terminology and initializing variables), but otherwise because it is so similar, it was very easy to pick up and learn. From a software engineering perspective, I think that Javascript is a good language because it is easily learned and is capable of  

One of my goals for this course was to learn how to perform well under pressure. Dr. Johnson's athletic software engineering concept is very useful for that. The best thing about this concept however, is that he gives practice WODs (which are like small programming assignments) so that you can practice for the actual WOD in class. I like how the practice WODs make you incorporate all of the concepts learned in a particular module under a slightly less pressure filled situation. Personally, I really like learning programming languages this way, as in the real world how you handle yourselves in pressure filled situations matters a lot. While the actual WODs are actually a little stressful, the practice WODs eliminate a lot of my pre-WOD jitters by allowing me to practice all the skills in a situation where it matters a lot less.
