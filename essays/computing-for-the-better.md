One of everyone's passions in life is to help someone or something for the better. For me, my hope is that I can eventually do this with a computer. Computers have always interested me from the moment I started using them. I would spend countless hours on the computer playing around with different programs and features. In high school, I would take all of the courses that involved using a computer to design and create things. Before I entered college however, I really didn't have any programming experience. After playing around with so many features and other programs, I was very curious to learn how to make them as well. 

Before I entered college, I had no idea how to implement any kind of program. I just thought some people came up with an idea and it magically would work. One of my goals in college was to effectively learn how to build and implement different programs. This is why software engineering really interests me. It doesn't just involve creating a program, but describes how to create a program. I have already programmed small applications and games (such as the projects on my site), but I haven't really created large scale programs. That is one of the things I hope to take from this class: the ability to learn how to design and implement large-scale programs and games in a way that it is easily accessible and fun for everyone.

Currently, I am in my first Software Engineering class. I hope to use the skills I learn in this class to create effective programs. One of the main things I would like to learn however, is how to overcome pressure situations and develop projects effectively. Honestly, I really don't know what my future holds yet. There has not been one class I have taken that has not been interesting. I hope to learn all I can about computer science and software engineering and make it a career for myself one day. However for now, I will continue to learn and continue to apply everything I do learn in the hopes I can change something for the better one day.
