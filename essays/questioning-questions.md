Just the other day, I was sitting in one of my lecture classes. The professor said "Gosh, I can't remember when I had a class that asked so many good questions". Most if not all teachers are always encouraging their students to ask questions, saying things like "No question is ever a bad question, so don't be afraid to ask". However, in the article <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"> How To Ask Questions the Smart Way</a>, while there may not be such a thing as a bad question, as shown, there are many bad ways to phrase a question.

Asking questions when it comes to coding is a daily practice. No programmer has ever written a perfect program on their first try. Sometimes, the mistakes made are very subtle and it can be hard to find, so they ask someone. However, all programmers are people. They have things that they could be doing, so if acting like a nuisance, they probably will just ignore your question. Some tips that the article lists are:
  1. Do not ask a question that an answer can be easily found by googling it
  2. Don't be rude when asking for a question because there the target audience for the question is other people
  3. Don't act unprofessional or give excuses for yourself

So what kinds of questions are good questions? They are the ones that are concise and to the point. They don't just ask for help. They describe the problem and the steps done already to try and eliminate it. The biggest point from the article, is that good questions don't just beg for help. They don't just say "Here's my problem. What's wrong with it?". They don't just demand an answer. This is very important when it comes to an area like Software Engineering because when developing and deploying software, it is important to understand the process. Again, almost no software engineer ever produced a fully functioning project the way they intended to the first time they made it. Especially when working in a group, the most efficient groups are the ones that when working together ask the efficient questions so that time isn't spent uselessy running through all the lines of code.
