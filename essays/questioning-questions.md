Just the other day, I was sitting in one of my lecture classes. The professor said "Gosh, I can't remember when I had a class that asked this many questions". Most if not all teachers are always encouraging their students to ask questions, saying things like "No question is ever a bad question, so don't be afraid to ask". However, in the article <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"><i How To Ask Questions the Smart Way</a>, while there may not be such a thing as a bad question, there are many bad ways to phrase questions.
