## Coding Standards: An Introduction
Beginning programmers often aren't taught the importance of coding standards. At that stage in time, all they really want is for their code to work properly. In fact, even for me, all I really cared about up until this point in my coding career was getting my code to run properly. What these beginning programmers don't realize however, is that coding standards are very useful when trying to analyze their code for bugs. Coding Standards offer easy readability, and (depending on the software used) might even give hints to some of the bugs in your code. In that way, as much of a pain as it may be to code to a certain standard, coding standards offer very important insights into your code.

## Initializing ESLint
From personal experiene, I've only really paid attention to coding standards for about a week. Specifically, I've been using ESLint in IntelliJ as the coding standard. Using IntelliJ with ESLint isn't necessarily the easiest thing to do, although it is helpful to understanding the code. To begin using ESLint, one must first change around some of the default preferences of IntelliJ. As of this writing, I have not yet found a way to change the default settings so I don't have to change them every time I start coding a new project. Unfortunately, this means that starting a project is often a very long and tedious process. 

## Impressions on ESLint
My first experience with ESLint was an interesting one. While ESLint used a lot of the same coding standards that I was used to from ICS 111 and ICS 211 (in Java), there were some very confusing aspects to it. One standard that I particularly had a hard time with at the start was that you are only allowed to have one extra line at the end of your code.
