## Coding Standards: An Introduction
Beginning programmers often aren't taught the importance of coding standards. At that stage in time, all they really want is for their code to work properly. In fact, even for me, all I really cared about up until this point in my coding career was getting my code to run properly. What these beginning programmers don't realize however, is that coding standards are very useful when trying to analyze their code for bugs. Coding standards offer easy readability, and (depending on the software used) might even give hints to some of the bugs in your code. In that way, as much of a pain as it may be to code to a certain standard, coding standards offer very important insights into your code.

## Initializing and Using ESLint
From personal experience, I've only really paid attention to coding standards for about a week. Specifically, I've been using ESLint in IntelliJ as the coding standard. Using IntelliJ with ESLint isn't necessarily the easiest thing to do, although it is helpful to understanding the code. To begin using ESLint, one must first change around some of the default preferences of IntelliJ. As of this writing, I have not yet found a way to change the default settings so I don't have to change them every time I start coding a new project. Unfortunately, this means that starting a project is often a very long and tedious process. Once this process has completed, IntelliJ will show a green checkmark when all of the code meets the standards. Therefore, while the code still needs to work, a green checkmark in the top right corner also has to show, otherwise some kind of standard hasn't been met. While most of the standards are very self explanatory, some of them are a little hard to get used to if there was no prior emphasis on coding standards. For me, it was a little hard to get the green checkmark on my first use, as there were a few stadards that I was not used to (spaces after parenthesis, no extra lines at the end of code, etc.). However, doing enough of the practice WODs for my class enough times was enough to emphasize these standards for me. 

## Impressions on ESLint
My first experience with ESLint was an interesting one. While ESLint used a lot of the same coding standards that I was used to from ICS 111 and ICS 211 (in Java), there were some very confusing aspects to it. One standard that I particularly had a hard time with at the start was that you are only allowed to have one extra line at the end of your code. The first time I programmed using ESLint, I had no idea why I had this error and found that just deleting a couple of extra lines at the end of my code actually fixed it. Otherwise, I haven't really found anything else that has really stumped me about ESLint's standards. Talking to some of my friends,
