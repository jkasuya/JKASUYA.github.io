On my first day of second grade, my teacher comes in and sits at her desk. She immediately starts stomping and clapping in sequence. She continues to do this for about five minutes until the confused students have to ask why she continues these motions. Here is a summarized version of her response: "Patterns are an essential part of life. No matter where you look, or what you are doing, there will be some kind of pattern around you." Over ten years later, as I sit and think about my numerous experiences, I have realized that she was right. I have also realized patterns aren't necessarily just a repeated sequence. Patterns are meant to be reused and incorporated, so that life can become easier. This is the concept of a Design Pattern: A repeatable solution to a commonly occuring problem in software design. Upon learning design patterns, my professor put a very good conceptual metaphor to them. "Patterns help newbies acquire the hard-won experience of ninjas." (Dr. Philip Johnson) Design patterns allow beginning programmers to have greater control and flow to their code like ninjas.

A ninja is a not just a master of ninjitsu, they are a master in a certain skill or activity. Like a ninja, a beginner programmer's greatest tool are design patterns!
